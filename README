The ngx_http_requestid_module module is designed to generate a unique request identifier.

The result of the module is an nginx variable which is randomly generated per request.

The identifier is a random 32 bit integer, which means it will often repeat itself, but this is usually good enough when combining it with time/server.

Configuration example:

http {
	requestid $my_request_id;
	more_set_headers 'X-Request-Id: $vod_request_id';

	...
}

Configuration:

Syntax: requestid $variable
Default: N/A
Context: http

Sets up an nginx variable with the requested name, the variable can be written to the access_log/returned as header etc.
